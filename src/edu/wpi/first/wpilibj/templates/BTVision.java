/**
 * Sample program to use NIVision to find rectangles in the scene that are illuminated
 * by a LED ring light. The camera sensitivity is set very low so as to only show light
 * sources and remove any distracting parts of the image.
 * 
 * The CriteriaCollection is the set of criteria that is used to filter the set of
 * rectangles that are detected.
 * 
 * The algorithm first does a color threshold operation that only takes objects in the
 * scene that have a bright green color component. Then a convex hull operation fills 
 * all the rectangle outlines (even the partially occluded ones). Then a small object filter
 * removes small particles that might be caused by green reflection scattered from other 
 * parts of the scene. Finally all particles are scored on rectangularity, aspect ratio,
 * and hollowness to determine if they match the target.
